      We specifically focus on <b>non-selective</b> activities that benefit the <b>whole composer community</b>: nothing we do is judged, juried, curated or auditioned. Our programs are either open to all, or first come first served. If we do it for anyone, we do it for <b>everyone</b>.

      The events we sponsor with a physical location are generally in the <b>Minneapolis / St. Paul</b> area, but we welcome the participation of musical inventors <b>everywhere</b>.
